# Bandwith and Latency

## Bandwidth

Bandwidth refers to the amount of data we can send over a network connection in an interval of time, e.g. a bandwidth of 100Mbps means that up to 100 Megabits of data can be transfered every second.

## Latency

The measure of time that passes between sending a network resource request and receiving a response.
Network latency can come from multiple sources: 
* latency between the client and server
* retrieving data from a data store
* compiling dynamic content on a server
* time taken for a browser to render a page

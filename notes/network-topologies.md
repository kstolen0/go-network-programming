# Network Topologies

Network topologies describe the organisation of nodes within a network. There are six common network topologies:  
* point to point : A direct link between two nodes
* Daisy chain : point to point segments joined in a daisy chain
* Bus : nodes connected along a shared network
* ring : nodes are connected within a closed loop, with data traveling in a single direction
* star : Central node with different point to point connections
* mesh : All nodes within a network have a direct connection with one-another


These topologies can also be combined into hygrid topologies, e.g. star-ring, bus-star, etc.
